If you want to use a dataset that has already been uploaded, you can choose “select a static dataset” and browse existing datasets.\n\n**2. Select a static dataset**\n\nThis is a fixed dataset that has to be manually updated to update the data visualization. To update this data, you must make changes to the data on your local device, then upload the new dataset as a CSV or Excel file.\n\n**3. Select a dynamic dataset**\n\nThese datasets update the data visualization automatically as new data is added to the source. Dynamic datasets are useful for visualizing streaming data that is updated frequently. Dynamic datasets are not configurable in the interface."
