      Contrast and color use are vital to accessibility. Users, including users with visual disabilities, must be able to perceive content on the page. In order to keep this tool accessible to users, we recommend following the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 color contrast requirements for Level AA.

      On the web, colors can be defined in a few ways. We use the hexadecimal, or HEX color, for customizing colors. In this format the red/green/blue values are presented as a combination of six letters or numbers. If you have your brand’s color in a different format, there are many free online tools to convert the color from one format into a HEX value.

      In WCAG 2, contrast is a measure of the difference in perceived “luminance” or brightness between two colors. This brightness difference is expressed as a ratio ranging from 1:1 (e.g. white on white) to 21:1 (e.g., black on a white). To give a frame of reference, on a white background:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Pure red (#FF0000) has a ratio of 4:1.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pure green (#00FF00) has a very low ratio of 1.4:1.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pure blue (#0000FF) has a contrast ratio of 8.6:1.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you received a warning about your primary color, it is because the color is not at least 4.5:1 contrast on a white background. You may continue, but your website will not meet most accessibility standards. We recommend that you choose another color that is part of your brand to use as the primary color.

      There are also many free “color contrast checker” tools that you can find to check if your colors meet WCAG 2.0 Level AA color contrast requirements.
