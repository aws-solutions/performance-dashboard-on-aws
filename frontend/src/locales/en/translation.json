In this format the red/green/blue values are presented as a combination of six letters or numbers. If you have your brand’s color in a different format, there are many free online tools to convert the color from one format into a HEX value.",

This brightness difference is expressed as a ratio ranging from 1:1 (e.g. white on white) to 21:1 (e.g., black on a white). To give a frame of reference, on a white background:",

        "ContrastDescription4": "Pure blue (#0000FF) has a contrast ratio of 8.6:1.",
        "ContrastDescription5": "If you received a warning about your primary color, it is because the color is not at least 4.5:1 contrast on a white background. You may continue, but your website will not meet most accessibility standards. We recommend that you choose another color that is part of your brand to use as the primary color.",
        "ContrastDescription6": "There are also many free “color contrast checker” tools that you can find to check if your colors meet WCAG 2.0 Level AA color contrast requirements."
